This  missing data has a significant impact on the accuracy and validity of statistical  analyses and prognostic models. Several imputation methods can be used to  estimate the missing values based on the available data. Although simple  imputations with mean or median generate reasonable results in terms of mean  absolute error, they do not account for the currentness of the data. Furthermore,  heterogeneous time span of data records adds to this complexity, especially in  high-frequency intensive care unit datasets. Therefore, we present DeepTSE, a  deep model that is able to cope with both, missing data and heterogeneous time  spans. We achieved promising results on the MIMIC-IV dataset that can compete  with and even outperform established imputation methods.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex syndrome that might be induced by different causes and is associated with an increased morbidity and  mortality. Therefore, it is a very heterogeneous syndrome and establishing a "one  size fits all" treatment approach might not work. This review aims to examine the  potential of personalized treatment strategies for AKI. RECENT FINDINGS: The  traditional diagnosis of AKI is based on changes of serum creatinine and urine  output, but these two functional biomarkers have several limitations. Recent  research identified different AKI phenotypes based on clinical features,  biomarkers, and pathophysiological pathways. Biomarkers, such as Cystatin C,  NGAL, TIMP2{$\ast$}IGFBP7, CCL14, and DKK-3, have shown promise in predicting AKI  development, renal recovery, and prognosis. Biomarker-guided interventions, such  as the implementation of the KDIGO bundle, have demonstrated an improvement in  renal outcomes in specific patient groups. SUMMARY: A personalized approach to  AKI treatment as well as research is becoming increasingly important as it allows  the identification of distinct AKI phenotypes and the potential for targeted  interventions. By utilizing biomarkers and clinical features, physicians might be  able to stratify patients into subphenotypes, enabling more individualized  treatment strategies. This review highlights the potential of personalized AKI  treatment, emphasizing the need for further research and large-scale clinical  trials to validate the efficacy of these approaches.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients, affecting up to 50\% of patients in the intensive care units. The lack  of standardized and open-source tools for applying the Kidney Disease Improving  Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria to time series, requires researchers to  implement classification algorithms of their own which is resource intensive and  might impact study quality by introducing different interpretations of edge  cases. This project introduces pyAKI, an open-source pipeline addressing this gap  by providing a comprehensive solution for consistent KDIGO criteria  implementation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pyAKI pipeline was developed and  validated using a subset of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care  (MIMIC)-IV database, a commonly used database in critical care research. We  constructed a standardized data model in order to ensure reproducibility. PyAKI  implements the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on AKI  diagnosis. After implementation of the diagnostic algorithm, using both serum  creatinine and urinary output data, pyAKI was tested on a subset of patients and  diagnostic accuracy was compared in a comparative analysis against annotations by  physicians. RESULTS: Validation against expert annotations demonstrated pyAKI's  robust performance in implementing KDIGO criteria. Comparative analysis revealed  its ability to surpass the quality of human labels with an accuracy of 1.0 in all  categories. DISCUSSION: The pyAKI pipeline is the first open-source solution for  implementing KDIGO criteria in time series data. It provides a standardized data  model and a comprehensive solution for consistent AKI classification in research  applications for clinicians and data scientists working with AKI data. The  pipeline's high accuracy make it a valuable tool for clinical research and  decision support systems. CONCLUSION: This work introduces pyAKI as an  open-source solution for implementing the KDIGO criteria for AKI diagnosis using  time series data with high accuracy and performance.},

METHODS: This  study was conducted as a retrospective evaluation of the ultrasound images of 492  fetuses in the three vessel view. The TTR was defined as the quotient of a.p.  thymus diameter and a.p. thoracic diameter. RESULTS: Fetuses that were preterm  showed larger TTR (p{$<$}0.001) the second trimester than those born after 37~weeks  of gestation were completed. The sensitivity of a binary classifier based on TTR  for predicting preterm birth (PTB) was 0.792 and the specificity 0.552.  CONCLUSIONS: In our study, fetuses affected by PTB showed enlarged thymus size.  These findings led us to hypothesize, that inflammation and immunomodulatory  processes are altered early in pregnancies affected by PTB. However, TTR alone is  not able to predict PTB.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains the leading cause of mortality in critically ill patients, and mortality is increased when acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs. The  Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline recommends the  implementation of supportive measures in patients at high risk for AKI. However,  it remains unclear to what extent these nephroprotective measures are implemented  in daily clinical practice in critically ill patients, especially those with  high-risk exposures such as sepsis. METHODS: We analyzed the Medical Information  Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database to identify septic patients with  and without AKI. The primary outcome of interest was the adherence to the KDIGO  bundle consisting of avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, implementation of a  functional hemodynamic monitoring, optimization of perfusion pressure and volume  status, close monitoring of renal function, avoidance of hyperglycemia, and  avoidance of radiocontrast agents. Secondary outcomes included the development of  AKI, progression of AKI, the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT), mortality,  and a composite end point consisting of progression of AKI and mortality within 7  days. RESULTS: Our analysis included 34,679 patients with sepsis with 1.6\%  receiving the complete bundle (10\% received 5, 42.3\% 4, 35.4\% 3, and 9.8\% 2  bundle components). In 56.4\%, nephrotoxic agents were avoided, and hemodynamic  optimization was reached in 86.5\%. Secondary end points were improved in patients  with bundle adherence. Avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs and optimization of  hemodynamics were significantly associated with lower rates of AKI and improved  patient outcomes, including 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the  KDIGO bundle is poor in patients with sepsis but may be associated with improved  outcomes.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Previous studies demonstrated that the implementation of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline-based bundle, consisting of  different supportive measures in patients at high risk for acute kidney injury  (AKI), might reduce rate and severity of AKI after surgery. However, the effects  of the care bundle in broader population of patients undergoing surgery require  confirmation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The BigpAK-2 trial is an international,  randomised, controlled, multicentre trial. The trial aims to enrol 1302 patients  undergoing major surgery who are subsequently admitted to the intensive care or  high dependency unit and are at high-risk for postoperative AKI as identified by  urinary biomarkers (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2*insulin like growth  factor binding protein 7 (TIMP-2)*IGFBP7)). Eligible patients will be randomised  to receive either standard of care (control) or a KDIGO-based AKI care bundle  (intervention). The primary endpoint is the incidence of moderate or severe AKI  (stage 2 or 3) within 72 hours after surgery, according to the KDIGO 2012  criteria. Secondary endpoints include adherence to the KDIGO care bundle,  occurrence and severity of any stage of AKI, change in biomarker values during 12  hours after initial measurement of (TIMP-2)*(IGFBP7), number of free days of  mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, need for renal replacement therapy  (RRT), duration of RRT, renal recovery, 30-day and 60-day mortality, intensive  care unit length-of-stay and hospital length-of-stay and major adverse kidney  events. An add-on study will investigate blood and urine samples from recruited  patients for immunological functions and kidney damage. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:  The BigpAK-2 trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of  the University of M{\"u}nster and subsequently by the corresponding Ethics Committee  of the participating sites. A study amendment was approved subsequently. In the  UK, the trial was adopted as an NIHR portfolio study. Results will be  disseminated widely and published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at  conferences and will guide patient care and further research. TRIAL REGISTRATION  NUMBER: NCT04647396.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence suggests an association of plasma Proenkephalin A 119-159 (penKid) with early and successful liberation from continuous renal  replacement therapy (CRRT) in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury.  However, these exploratory results are derived from a monocentric trial and  therefore require external validation in a multicenter cohort. METHODS: Data and  plasma samples from the "Effect of Regional Citrate Anticoagulation versus  Systemic Heparin Anticoagulation During Continuous Kidney Replacement Therapy on  Dialysis Filter Life Span and Mortality Among Critically Ill Patients With Acute  Kidney Injury-A Randomized Clinical Trial" (RICH Trial) were used for this  validation study. PenKid was measured in all plasma samples available at CRRT  initiation and at day 3 of CRRT. Patients were categorized into low and high  penKid groups with a cutoff at 100~pmol/l. Competing-risk time-to-event analyses  were performed. Competing risk endpoints were successful and unsuccessful  liberation from CRRT, the latter meaning death or initiation of a new RRT within  one week of discontinuation of primary CRRT. Then penKid was compared to urinary  output. RESULTS: Low pre-CRRT penKid levels at CRRT initiation were not  associated with early and successful liberation from CRRT compared to patients  with high pre-CRRT penKid levels [subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.01, 95\% CI  0.73-1.40, p\,=\,0.945]. However, the landmark analysis on day 3 of ongoing CRRT  demonstrated an association between low penKid levels and successful liberation  from CRRT (sHR 2.35, 95\% CI 1.45-3.81, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and an association between high  penKid levels and unsuccessful liberation (sHR 0.46, 95\% CI 0.26-0.80,  p\,=\,0.007). High daily urinary output ({$>$}\,436~ml/d) was even stronger associated  with successful liberation (sHR 2.91, 95\% CI 1.80-4.73, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) compared to  penKid. DISCUSSION: This study suggests that penKid may be a competent biomarker  to monitor the recovery of kidney function during CRRT. This is in line with  previous findings and investigated this concept in a multicenter cohort. Again,  low penKid was associated with early and successful CRRT liberation, but was  outperformed by high daily urinary output. The findings of this study now warrant  further evaluation in prospective studies or a randomized controlled trial. Trial  registration The RICH Trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02669589.  Registered 01 February 2016.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) remains the key rescue therapy for critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI). However, there are  currently no tools available to predict successful liberation from RRT.  Biomarkers may allow for risk~stratification and individualization of treatment  strategies. Proenkephalin A 119-159 (penKid) has been suggested as a promising  marker of kidney function in the context of AKI, but has not yet~been evaluated  for RRT liberation in critically ill patients with AKI. METHODS: This post hoc  analysis included 210 patients from the randomized~clinical ELAIN trial and  penKid levels were measured in the blood of these patients. Competing risk  time-to-event analyses were performed for pre-RRT penKid at initiation of RRT and  in a landmark analysis at day 3 after initiation of RRT. Competing risk endpoints  were successful liberation from RRT or death without prior liberation from RRT.  RESULTS: Low pre-RRT penKid levels (penKid\,{$\leq$}\,89~pmol/l) at RRT initiation were  associated with early and successful liberation from RRT compared to patients  with high pre-RRT penKid levels (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.83, 95\%CI  1.26-2.67, p\,=\,0.002, estimated 28d-cumulative incidence function (28d-CIF) of  successful liberation from RRT 61\% vs. 45\%, p\,=\,0.022). This association  persisted in the landmark analysis on day 3 of RRT (sHR 1.78, 95\%CI 1.17-2.71,  p\,=\,0.007, 28d-CIF of successful liberation from RRT 67\% vs. 47\%, p\,=\,0.018). For  both time points, no difference in the competing event of death was detected.  CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with RRT-dependent AKI, plasma penKid  appears to be a useful biomarker for the prediction of shorter duration and  successful liberation from RRT and may allow an individualized approach to guide  strategies of RRT liberation in critically ill patients with RRT-dependent AKI.
