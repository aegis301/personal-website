By utilizing biomarkers and clinical features, physicians might be able to stratify patients into subphenotypes, enabling more individualized treatment strategies. This review highlights the potential of personalized AKI treatment, emphasizing the need for further research and large-scale clinical trials to validate the efficacy of these approaches."

      "summary": "Missing data is a common problem in the intensive care unit as a variety of factors contribute to incomplete data collection in this clinical setting. This missing data has a significant impact on the accuracy and validity of statistical analyses and prognostic models. Several imputation methods can be used to estimate the missing values based on the available data. Although simple imputations with mean or median generate reasonable results in terms of mean absolute error, they do not account for the currentness of the data. Furthermore, heterogeneous time span of data records adds to this complexity, especially in high-frequency intensive care unit datasets. Therefore, we present DeepTSE, a deep model that is able to cope with both, missing data and heterogeneous time spans. We achieved promising results on the MIMIC-IV dataset that can compete with and even outperform established imputation methods."

      "summary": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill patients and is associated with long-term complications and an increased mortality. This work presents preliminary findings from the first freely available European intensive care database released by Amsterdam UMC. A machine learning (ML) model was developed to predict AKI in the intensive care unit 12 hours before the actual event. Main features of the model included medications and hemodynamic parameters. Our models perform with an accuracy of 81.8% on moderate to severe AKI and 79.8% on all AKI patients. Those results can compete with models reported in the literature and introduce an ML model for AKI based on European patient data."
